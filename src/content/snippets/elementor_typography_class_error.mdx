PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Error: Class "Elementor\Core\Schemes\Typography" not found
This error occurs when Elementor is unable to find the Typography class, which is essential for handling typography settings in Elementor widgets.
This can happen due to a few reasons, such as a corrupted Elementor installation or a conflict with another plugin or theme.
Often other plugins or themes rely in the Typography class, so disabling Elementor will cause other plugins to fail as well.
Elementor has deprecated the Typography class in version 3.10.0, you may not encounter this issue when you update plugins that rely on it.

This is a simple bash script that replaces the Typography class with a hardcoded values to prevent the error from occurring.

In ideal workld you would update the plugins that rely on the Typography class, but this is a quick fix to get your site back up and running.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the directory to search, usually the plugins directory
# Adjust the path as necessary for your WordPress installation
# For example, if your WordPress installation is in /var/www/html, you might set
# DIRECTORY="/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins"
# For WP Engine it usually is:
DIRECTORY="/home/wpe-user/sites/SITE_NAME/wp-content/plugins"

# Define the replacements as an associative array
declare -A REPLACEMENTS=(
    ["Scheme_Typography::TYPOGRAPHY_1"]="1"
    ["Scheme_Typography::TYPOGRAPHY_2"]="2"
    ["Scheme_Typography::TYPOGRAPHY_3"]="3"
    ["Scheme_Typography::TYPOGRAPHY_4"]="4"
    ["Scheme_Color::get_type()"]="'color'"
    ["Scheme_Color::COLOR_1"]="1"
    ["Scheme_Color::COLOR_2"]="2"
    ["Scheme_Color::COLOR_3"]="3"
    ["Scheme_Color::COLOR_4"]="4"
)

# Find all PHP files in the directory and subdirectories
find "$DIRECTORY" -type f -name "*.php" | while read -r file; do
    # Loop through the replacements and apply them
    for key in "${!REPLACEMENTS[@]}"; do
        sed -i "s/${key}/${REPLACEMENTS[$key]}/g" "$file"
    done
    echo "Processed: $file"
done

echo "All replacements completed."
```
