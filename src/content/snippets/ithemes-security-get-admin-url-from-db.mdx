How to find WordPress admin when iThemes Security is installed?
### Important note! You need to have access to WordPress database.

1. Connect to the WordPress database
2. Find "your-prefix_options" table in the WordPress (your-prefix, usually it's "wp" but iThemes Security could change it)
3. Search for option_name "itsec-storage"
4. Search for "slug" in the option_value output

```sql
select * from wp_options where option_name='itsec-storage';
```
