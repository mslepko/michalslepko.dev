I like working in command line, I use Git in command line (except dealing with PRs), to quickly edit files I prefer Vim over Sublime Text. All my servers and computers are using the same list of aliasses, commands, functions.

![iTerm](https://slepko.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screenshot-2017-01-13-07.40.49.png)![]()

I keep all of it in Github repos: [https://github.com/mslepko/dotfiles](https://github.com/mslepko/dotfiles)

Most of them are self explanatory but in the next couple of days I'll briefly explain them

1. [.aliases](https://slepko.co.uk/bash-aliases/)
2. [.exports](https://slepko.co.uk/bash-exports/)
3. [.functions](https://slepko.co.uk/bash-functions/)
4. [.gitconfig](https://slepko.co.uk/git-gitconfig/)
5. [.gitignore](https://slepko.co.uk/git-gitignore/)
6. [.vimrc](https://slepko.co.uk/vimrc/)
7. [.inputrc](https://slepko.co.uk/inputrc/)
8. [.tmux.conf](https://slepko.co.uk/tmux-conf/)
9. [.bash_profile](https://slepko.co.uk/bash_profile/)
