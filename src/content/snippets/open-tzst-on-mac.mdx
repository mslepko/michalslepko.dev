If you have a Plesk backup file with a .tzst extension, you may be wondering how to open it on a Mac. This file format is not natively supported by macOS, but you can easily decompress it using the terminal. Here's how to open a .tzst file on a Mac:
1. Install the zstd using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install zstd
```

2. Decompress the .tzst file using the zstd command:
```bash
zstd -d yourfile.tzst
```

Replace "yourfile.tzst" with the name of your .tzst file.

This will decompress the file and create a new file with the same name but without the .tzst extension.

There are GUI tools available to open .tzst files on Mac, but using the terminal is a quick and easy way to decompress the file for free.
