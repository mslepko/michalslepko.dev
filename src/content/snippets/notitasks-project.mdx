# Building NotiTasks - Learning Next.js and Modern Web Development

As a developer who's always looking to learn new technologies and frameworks, I decided to build [NotiTasks](https://notitasks.com/) as a way to dive deep into modern web development. While I primarily work with PHP and traditional web technologies, I wanted to explore the React ecosystem and see what modern JavaScript frameworks could offer.

## The Learning Motivation

My decision to build NotiTasks came from several motivations:

### **Exploring New Technologies**
I wanted to learn:
- **Next.js**: The React framework everyone was talking about
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **ChakraUI**: Component library for React
- **Supabase**: Modern database solution
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript

### **Solving a Real Problem**
While learning, I also wanted to build something useful. As a Notion user myself, I found that task management within Notion could be more efficient. The idea was to create a tool that would enhance the Notion experience rather than replace it.

## The Technology Stack

### **Frontend**
- **Next.js 13+**: For the React framework with App Router
- **TailwindCSS**: For utility-first styling
- **ChakraUI**: For pre-built components
- **TypeScript**: For type safety

### **Backend**
- **Supabase**: For database and authentication

### **Deployment**
- **Vercel**: For hosting and deployment
- **GitHub**: For version control

## The Learning Journey

### **Getting Started with Next.js**
Coming from a PHP background, Next.js was a revelation. The file-based routing, server-side rendering, and API routes made so much sense. I learned:

```typescript
// File-based routing in Next.js 13
app/
  dashboard/
    page.tsx      // /dashboard
    tasks/
      page.tsx    // /dashboard/tasks
      [id]/
        page.tsx  // /dashboard/tasks/[id]
```

### **TailwindCSS Experience**
After years of writing traditional CSS, TailwindCSS felt liberating. The utility-first approach meant:

```tsx
// Instead of writing custom CSS
<div className="flex items-center justify-between p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow">
  <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Task Title</h2>
  <span className="px-2 py-1 text-sm bg-blue-100 text-blue-800 rounded">High</span>
</div>
```

### **ChakraUI Components**
ChakraUI provided a great balance between customization and speed:

```tsx
import { Box, Button, Text, VStack } from '@chakra-ui/react'

const TaskCard = ({ task }) => (
  <Box p={4} borderWidth="1px" borderRadius="lg">
    <VStack align="start" spacing={2}>
      <Text fontSize="lg" fontWeight="semibold">{task.title}</Text>
      <Button size="sm" colorScheme="blue">Edit</Button>
    </VStack>
  </Box>
)
```

### **Supabase Integration**
Learning Supabase was eye-opening. The combination of database, authentication, and real-time features in one platform was powerful:

```typescript
// Real-time subscriptions
const { data: tasks } = useSubscription(
  supabase
    .from('tasks')
    .on('*', payload => {
      console.log('Change received!', payload)
    })
    .subscribe()
)
```

## Key Features That I Planned to Build

### **Task Management**
- Create, edit, and delete tasks
- Priority levels and due dates
- Drag-and-drop reordering
- Real-time updates

### **Notion Integration**
- Import tasks from Notion databases
- Sync changes back to Notion
- Maintain Notion's data structure

### **User Experience**
- Responsive design for all devices
- Dark/light mode support
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Offline capability

## Challenges and Solutions

### **State Management**
Coming from PHP, managing client-side state was new territory. I learned to use React hooks effectively:

```typescript
const [tasks, setTasks] = useState<Task[]>([])
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)

const addTask = async (task: Task) => {
  setLoading(true)
  try {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('tasks')
      .insert([task])
    if (data) setTasks([...tasks, data[0]])
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error adding task:', error)
  } finally {
    setLoading(false)
  }
}
```

### **TypeScript Learning Curve**
TypeScript was initially challenging but became invaluable:

```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string
  title: string
  description?: string
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
  due_date?: string
  completed: boolean
  user_id: string
  created_at: string
}
```

### **Deployment and CI/CD**
Learning Vercel's deployment process was smooth:

```json
// vercel.json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "framework": "nextjs"
}
```

## The Impact on My Development Skills

### **Modern JavaScript**
I gained deep understanding of:
- ES6+ features
- Async/await patterns
- Modern React patterns
- TypeScript benefits

### **Full-Stack Development**
The project taught me:
- API design and development
- Database design and optimization
- Authentication and authorization
- Real-time features

### **Development Workflow**
I learned modern development practices:
- Git workflow with feature branches
- Code review processes
- Testing strategies
- Performance optimization

## Future Enhancements

I'm planning to add:
- **Mobile App**: React Native version
- **Advanced Analytics**: Task completion metrics
- **Team Features**: Collaborative task management
- **API Integration**: More third-party tools
- **Advanced Notifications**: Email and push notifications

## Lessons Learned

### **Technology Choices**
- **Next.js**: Excellent for full-stack React applications
- **TailwindCSS**: Great for rapid prototyping and consistent design
- **Supabase**: Perfect for small to medium applications
- **TypeScript**: Worth the learning curve for type safety

### **Development Process**
- **Start Small**: Begin with core features
- **Iterate Quickly**: Use modern tools for fast development
- **Focus on UX**: User experience is as important as functionality
- **Document Everything**: Good documentation saves time later

## The Bigger Picture

Building NotiTasks taught me that modern web development is incredibly powerful. The combination of React, Next.js, and modern tooling makes it possible to build sophisticated applications quickly and efficiently.

## Conclusion

NotiTasks represents my journey into modern web development. It's not just a task management tool - it's a testament to the power of learning new technologies and applying them to solve real problems.
