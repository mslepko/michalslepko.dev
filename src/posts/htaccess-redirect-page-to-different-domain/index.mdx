I've changed the domain of this blog to a subdomain and I needed to redirect old post to new URL.

On old domain in `.htaccess` file I've added rewrite rules.

```
<code class="bash">RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^javascript-array-sort  https://snippets.slepko.co.uk/javascript-array-sort/ [r=301,l]
```

Request to `https://DOMAIN/javascript-array-sort` will be redirected to `https://snippets.slepko.co.uk/javascript-array-sort/`.

`r=301` - permanent redirect `l` (lowercase l) - last, this is the last rule and stop processing the ruleset
