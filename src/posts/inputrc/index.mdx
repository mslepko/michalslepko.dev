### Make Tab autocomplete regardless of filename case

```
<code class="bash">set completion-ignore-case on
```

### List all matches in case multiple possible completions are possible

```
<code class="bash">set show-all-if-ambiguous on
```

### Immediately add a trailing slash when autocompleting symlinks to directories

```
<code class="bash">set mark-symlinked-directories on
```

### Use the text that has already been typed as the prefix for searching through commands (basically more intelligent Up/Down behavior)

```
<code class="bash">"\e[B": history-search-forward
"\e[A": history-search-backward
```

### Ctrl left, ctrl right for moving on the readline by word

```
<code class="bash">"\e[1;5C": forward-word
"\e[1;5D": backward-word
```

### Do not autocomplete hidden files unless the pattern explicitly begins with a dot

```
<code class="bash">set match-hidden-files off
```

### Show all autocomplete results at once

```
<code class="bash">set page-completions off
```

### If there are more than 200 possible completions for a word, ask to show them all

```
<code class="bash">set completion-query-items 200
```

### Show extra file information when completing, like `ls -F` does

```
<code class="bash">set visible-stats on
```

### Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after the cursor. For example, when the current line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the Readline used by Bash 4.)

```
<code class="bash">set skip-completed-text on
```

### Allow UTF-8 input and output, instead of showing stuff like \$'\\0123\\0456'

```
<code class="bash">set input-meta on
set output-meta on
set convert-meta off
```

### Use Alt/Meta + Delete to delete the preceding word

```
<code class="bash">"\e[3;3~": kill-word
```
