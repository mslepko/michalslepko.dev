How to install PHP Composer globally?

Composer is a dependency manager for PHP, you can find more on <https://getcomposer.org>.

To install PHP Composer on Linux or Mac run this command in terminal / command line

```
<code class="bash">curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
```

Now just run `composer` in order to run Composer instead of `php composer.phar`.
